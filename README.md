# password-generator
this code will make password as much as you want

it will ask for login credentials and then continue the code after that it will ask if you want special characters for password and then length of password and at the end it asks for number of password eg.1.5 it will give you password with Uppercase and lowercase letter with number and if you want with special character
We recommend using more than 12 lengths for your password, for your safety:)
